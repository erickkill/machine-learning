# Detecting Diabetes
## Overview
PIMA Indians [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of 0 indicates that the patient does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient does have diabetes.
