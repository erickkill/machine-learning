    "## Company Information\n",
    " \n",
    "Apprentice Chef, Inc. is an innovative company with a unique spin on cooking at home. Developed for the busy professional that has little to no skills in the kitchen, they offer a wide selection of daily-prepared gourmet meals delivered directly to your door.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each meal set takes at most 30 minutes to finish cooking at home and also comes with Apprentice Chef's award- winning disposable cookware (i.e. pots, pans, baking trays, and utensils), allowing for fast and easy cleanup. Ordering meals is very easy given their user-friendly online platform and mobile app. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "In an effort to diversify their revenue stream, Apprentice Chef, Inc. has launched Halfway There, a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday (halfway through the work week). The executives at Apprentice Chef also believe this endeavor will create a competitive advantage based on its unique product offering of hard to find local wines. \n",
    " \n",
    "Halfway There has been exclusively offered to all of the customers in the dataset you received, and the executives would like to promote this service to a wider audience. They have tasked you with analyzing their data, developing your top insights, and building a machine learning model to predict which customers will subscribe to this service. \n",

For example, despite the customer with the most orders (493 orders), 52 other customers had more revenue. With this information, it would signal substantial discounts or inconsistent pricing. Similarly, we see the customer with the highest amount of time spent on the website with 2685 minutes, had less revenue than 480 customers (almost 25% of the customer base).\n",

    "These results only represent the first few lines of the model.Looking at the performance, we can see we have a lot of variables that have a p-value higher than 0.05. In general we want to reject variables that fall above this threshold. Lower than or equal to 0.05 mean's the variables are statistically significant for our model's performance and if we were to remove one we could significantly alter the results. However, we cannot base that if we do remove all p-value that are higher than 0.05 our model will be sound. Removing the high p-values would only give us addtional support to improve and continue to develop the model (Source: [Mcleod (2019) Simply Psychology](https://www.simplypsychology.org/p-value.html))\n",

    "Below we will remove the flagged p-values one by one if they have a higher than 0.05 value, and run the model again. Our goal is to narrow down the features. The reason we remove one p-value at a time is because if we decided to remove all the high values simultaneously it may effect other variables. So we must remove one by one, then observe the changes, then proceed to remove - this ensures our results remain in tack and will not cause any skewed performance.

The goal is continuously split the tree and leafs by every new features the model outputs.\n",

    "SVM offers very high accuracy compared to other classifiers such as logistic regression, and decision trees. It is known for its kernel trick to handle nonlinear input spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Support vectors are the data points, which are closest to the divider known as the hyperplane of the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "A hyperplane finds a way to separates the data based on certain characteristics. The main goal is the develop a way to divide the dataset in the most efficient was possible, with the final output looking to measure the distance between the nearest points - known as the margin. Once the margin is identified,  the hyperplane that has the furthest margin between the data points in the dataset is selected.\n",

    "\n",
    "Users that signed up for their accounts using their professional work emails had shown strong significance in model performance. Users with professional emails totaled 36% (696 users) of the entire customer base and converted 80% of the time to the cross-sell campaign. \\\n",
    "\n",
    "With this information, we can potentially determine that users signing up with their work email could be earning more income, have less time to cook and prepare their food, and are at minimum age to consume wine. These users would be getting a more efficient cooking experience using Apprentice Chef’s product and would purchase wine more frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insight #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying customers into discount levels, Basic, Premium, and no discount, there were no users in the basic discount, compared to 72% (1400) of users with a premium discount, and 546 users with no discounts.  Surprisingly the wine promotion had the same success rate, 68% for both premium and no discount groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "One would expect that customers with discounts would be more attracted to the wine promotion. However, the company could be losing more money, offering a premium discount to customers who are not converting the cross-sell wine promotion.  Financially the discounts could be counterproductive for cross-sell success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "The business opportunity for Apprentice Chef would be to increase its presence in corporate partnerships. We saw users with professional emails, produce more robust results in converting the wine promotion. \n",
    "\n",
    "The startup culture, in particular, have great meal benefits, providing their employee's food at lunch and sometimes at night post work. On average, Apprentice Chef's meals cost $16.50, and a company spends $15-17 per employee meal (HighFive, 2019). Apprentice Chef should be approaching companies to provide exclusive partnership prices to supply their meals to their employees, so instead of staying back to eat lunch or dinner, they can head home and cook for themselves and their family. \n",
    "\n",
    "Competitor Blue Apron, provide exclusive discounts for corporates depending on meal frequency and company size (Blue Apron). With these employees spending more time at home and enjoying the services from Apprentice Chef, the wine promotion could be easier to convert. Given that their employers will supply the employees Apprentice Chef meals, the employee could add the wine promotion out of their pocket and wouldn't incur that much cost overall.\n",
    "Working with companies to supply meals to their employees could monumentally increase new users, grow revenue, and cross-sell success of the wine promotion.\n",
