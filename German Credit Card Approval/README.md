# German Credit Card Approval
This R script shows a comparison between a logistic model and a decision tree model to determine the probability someone will get accepted or rejected for a credit card application.

## Objectives
1. Clean data
2. Build linear regression
3. Build logisitc regression
4. Build decision tree model
5. Test models on datsets
6. Check performance of models
7. Visualize model performance for comparison

## Results
Overall we can se that it is fairly even with logistic regression showing better performance but eventually the decision tree is performance better. Using this data we can achieve a relatively high score for predicting the likelyhood of customers being approved or not based on their characteristics.
