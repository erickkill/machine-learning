# House Congress 
## Overview
I will be working with a dataset obtained from the [CI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Congressional+Voting+Records).

The goal will be to predict their party affiliation ('Democrat' or 'Republican') based on how they voted on certain key issues. Here, it's worth noting that we have preprocessed this dataset to deal with missing values. This is so that your focus can be directed towards understanding how to train and evaluate supervised learning models.

Using k-Nearest Neighbors to fit and predict the model performance.
